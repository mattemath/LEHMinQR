This repository accompanies the manuscript by Pellin et a. "Inferring the dynamics of quasi-reaction systems via nonlinear local mean field approximations".

The abstract of the paper is the following:

_Various processes, such as cell differentiation and disease spreading, can be
modelled as quasi-reaction systems of particles using stochastic differential
equations. The existing Local Linear Approximation (LLA) method infers
the parameters driving these systems from measurements of particle abun-
dances over time. While dense observations of the process in time should in
theory improve parameter estimation, LLA fails in these situations due to
numerical instability. Defining a latent event history model of the underly-
ing quasi-reaction system resolves this problem. A computationally efficient
Expectation-Maximization algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation,
incorporating an extended Kalman filter for evaluating the latent reactions.
A simulation study demonstrates the methodâ€™s performance and highlights
the settings where it is particularly advantageous compared to the existing
LLA approaches. An illustration of the method applied to the diffusion of
COVID-19 in Italy is presented._
